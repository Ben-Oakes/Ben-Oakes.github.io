    <p>One of the hobbies I am most interested in life is debate. Debate has been a large part of my life since I got involved with my highschool's debate team, and it continues to be a part of my life now in college through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UMissDebate/">University's debate union</a> that I am a part of. I have met many of my best friends in life through attending debate clubs and tournaments, and have developed communication skills that are critical to surviving in the world of business. <br> Debate comes in many forms, but the most common format of debate is Public Forum, where 2 people are given a topic to debate and flip a coin to decide who speaks first as well as who is on the "pro" side and who is on the "con" side. The two speakers then take turns arguing for and against eachother's points in speaches that last around 4-5 minutes, the entire round lasts about 45 minutes total.</p>
