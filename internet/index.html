									<h2>When world governments and corperations control our internet, our freedoms will be abolished.</h2>
									<p>Government regulation of the internet has always been a controversial topic amongst people. Because of legal issues such as Intellectual Property and piracy, there will always be some form of regulation over what is and is not allowed to be posted. But how far is too far? At some point we have to draw a line and stop governments from censoring speech on the internet, especially on social platforms.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why is censorship dangerous?</h2>
						<p>Censorship on the internet is dangerous for the same reasons that censorship of news media is dangerous. In today's political climate, the rise of the internet has become a key component in the spread of information and has become a large part of protests around the globe. When access to the internet is restricted or limited by local governments, it is almost always due to an anti-free speech agenda. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hayesbrown/russia-cut-off-the-internet-in-crimea">A good example of this happening in the real world is when in 2016 Russia  disabled all internet access in Crimea</a></li> in order to shut down a rebellion force. In fact, internet censorship by governments has become such a big issue that <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country">wikipedia maintains a list</a></li> of countries that have censored their citizen's internet access.
							<br><br>
						Of course, not all examples of internet censorship are as extreme as cutting off internet access entirely. Some forms of internet censorship are much more subtle, but still have a negative effect on our society. China is a good example of this. Most parts of China are limited by a system of internet regulation technologies known as <a href=https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Great_Firewall>"The Great Firewall."</a></li> The idea behind the Great Firewall is that citizens can still access the internet, but access to western websites that portray ideas that go against the Chinese government are never seen. This creates a system that is actually even more scary than having no access to the internet. Many citizens of China do not even realize that their government is censoring websites that allow negative ideas about their government. Because of this, it is easier for China to erode human rights as their citizens are less likely to know that things are different outside of their country. You won't join in on the protesting if you don't know that you have rights in the first place.

									<h2>But this would never happen in America, right? Surely we don't have anything to worry about.</h2>
						<p>If you said this twenty years ago, I might have listened, but things are different now. In our current political society, social media censorship is a very real issue. <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/free-speech-debate-swirls-as-elected-officials-block-on-social-media-1.3539947">Several public officials have been caught using blocking tools to stop people from critisizing them on twitter. </a> Many lawyers and historians are beginning to argue that <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-02-19/donald-trumps-tweets-are-now-presidential-records">Donald Trump should not be able to delete his tweets</a>, as doing so should be considered deleting official presidential statements.
							<br><br>
						"But that's not actual censorship!," I hear you cry, "censorship is when the government takes content off the internet that they didn't make!" Well if this is your definition of censorship, then you may be displeased to know that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/business/media/trump-libel-laws.html">Trump administration is currently looking into passing new libel laws that would allow people to be legally punished for making defamatory statements about politicians</a> on the internet. Not to even mention the failed <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA Act</a> of 2012, that would have made it legal for companies to delete content off of the internet if they believe it hurts their brand. This act was so close to being passed that <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/sopa-pipa">Google famously censored their own logo in protest of it potentially passing.</a>

									<h2><font color=blue>Conclusion:</font></h2>
									<p>Overall, there is no good reason for censorship to happen on the internet. In most cases where speech has been censored on the internet, it has had negative consequences. To regulate the internet is to regulate free speech itself. The internet is a tool for the people, maintained by the people, and it should stay that way.</p>
