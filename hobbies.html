    <p>One of the hobbies I am most interested in life is debate. Debate has been a large part of my life since I got involved with my highschool's debate team, and it continues to be a part of my life now in college through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UMissDebate/">University's debate union</a> that I am a part of. I have met many of my best friends in life through attending debate clubs and tournaments, and have developed communication skills that are critical to surviving in the world of business.</p>
    <p style="color:lightcoral ;font-family: Courier New ;font-size: 12pt;">Notable people who have practiced competitive debate either in college or high school include:</p>
    <p title="Ted Cruz actually did really well in debate and made it to several huge tournaments" style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/us/politics/ted-cruz-honed-political-skills-in-princeton-debate-club.html">- Ted Cruz</a><br>
    - Oprah<br>
    - Adam Sandler<br>
    - Malcolm X</p>
    <p>When thinking about the importance of debate and the impact it can have on people, I am always reminded of a quote that my debate coach would sign all of her emails with. The quote is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>, an extremely influential civil rights activist and poet. It is not necessarily a quote about debate but I think it applies to the topic well. The quote reads as follows:</p>
    <pre>People will forget what you said, 
people will forget what you did, 
but people will never forget how you made them feel. </pre>
